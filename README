Othello Judge Version 2.0

Works fine on ubuntu and Redhat.

Requirements:
-JRE(Java Runtime Environment)
-gcc/g++


HOW TO RUN :
1.Extract the file and change directory to extracted folder.
$ cd othello_v2.0

2.Compile your code.

3.Run the shell script run.sh
bash run.sh './path_of_player1_objectfile' './path_of_player2_objectfile'

e.g.
$ cd othello_v2.0
$ g++ sample_player.cpp -o player1
$ g++ sample_player_again.cpp -o player2
$ g++ client.cpp -o client
$ bash run.sh './player1' './player2'

After few seconds you will be able to see window of our Judge showing the game.
Finally you can check the moves played during the game in Moves_out file in the same folder.


In case their is some problem with the judge, try killing these processe then rerunning it.
java
client
<name_of_player1_objectfile>
<name_of_player2_objectfile>

If you want to play a match on LAN then :

Host the server using :
$ java Main
Now on each client's(player's/coder's) computer do :
$ ./client './name_of_player's_objectfile' <IP_address_of_server>

This judge is not tested for Global IP. Just hope that it does work .


Finally , to compile judge's code use Makefile :
$ make

This is an open source code. Use it as you wish.
